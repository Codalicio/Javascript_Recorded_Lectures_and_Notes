Question - 2.1 : Describe the history of Javascript?
Answer :
Javascript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape 
Communications Corporation.
It was originally called Mocha, Then changed to LiveScript, and finally, 
it was given the name JavaScript to leverage the popularity of Java, which 
was a popular programming language at the time.
Javascript was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0, a popular web 
browser of the time.
In 1996, Javascript was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers 
Association (ECMA) and it was standardized as ECMAScript. This standardized 
version of Javascript is still used today and it is supported by all modern 
web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft 
Edge, etc.
In the early days of Javascript, it was primarily used for simple things 
like form validation and simple mouse interactions, but as browsers became 
more powerful and web standards evolved, Javascript became more widely used 
for building more complex web applications.
With the introduction of popular libraries and frameworks like JQuery, AngularJS, 
React, and Vue.js, it has become easier to build complex and powerful web 
applications using Javascript.
The emergence of Node.js in 2009 made it possible to run Javascript on the 
server-side and it became more popular as a full-stack language, allowing 
for code reuse and sharing between the client-side and the server-side.
